Technical challenges

The technical challenges we may face doing this project:
1.    Ultrasonic sensors might not detect a car if it is not close enough.
2.    Additional financial and physical resources will be required to scale the system.
3.    Internet connection profoundly affects keeping the system in real time 
4.    Android application must keep up to date with the latest Android version.
5.    Android application must be a scalable and extendable, user-friendly application with a high             level of performance and services.
